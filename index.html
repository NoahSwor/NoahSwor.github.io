    <h1>Hello! My name is Noah Swor</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Florida, pursuing a major in computer science and minoring in statistics.</p>
    <p>I love learning. I hope to search out all knowledge that I can find, to unravel all the mysteries of mind.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Cubing</h1>
    <p>in my free time, I practice solving the Rubik's Cube
        <br> Competitions are sanctioned by the <a href='https://www.worldcubeassociation.org' target='_blank'>World Cube Association</a> with hundreds of thousands of participants worldwide.
        <br> You can learn more about cubing through the documentary <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81092143" target='_blank'>The Speed Cubers (2020)</a> on Netflix.
        <br> My proudest accomplishments across my 7 years of cubing are:
        <ul>
            <li>A 2nd place in the world blindfolded solve of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2b72g9JMO8" target="_blank">15 seconds</a> in 2022.</li>
            <li>A silver medal in fewest moves at the North American Championships in 2024.</li>
            <li>Bronze medals in blindfolded at the 2022 and 2024 North American Championships.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://wca.cuber.pro/kinch/persons" target="_blank">current 8th best all rounder in the world</a>, being well ranked in all 17 officially recognized events.</li>
        </ul>  
        outside of competing, I enjoy making youtube videos talking about how to practice, and interviewing other top competitors.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>I love all things music. Right now I play bass and guitar for a worship band on campus. 
        <br> Some of my favorite bands include Yes, King Crimson and Van Der Graaf Generator. I'm also a fan of jazz artists like John Coltrane and Chick Corea.
        <br> For modern music, I love video game soundtracks! I love OSTs like that of the Persona series, Oneshot, Undertale, Pokemon and more. It is exciting seeing these soundtracks being arranged by young artists today.
